# IN5020 â€“ Distributed Systems

The course is an introduction to principles and practice of the design of distributed systems. The course covers fundamental models for distributed systems, distributed middleware with the focus on object-based middleware and component-based architectures, distributed algorithms for consensus and other underlying problems, and modern-day challenges of distributed processing technology such as cloud, multimedia and IoT. 


## Topics: 

- System models
- Distributed objects and object-based middleware
- Web Services
- Component-based distributed systems
- Communication paradigms
- Time and coordination
- Paxos and distributed transactions
- Replication
- Peer-to-peer systems
- Mobile and ubiquitous computing
- Distributed multimedia systems
- Cloud, IoT, etc.
